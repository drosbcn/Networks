    "Newman and Girvan introduced 'modularity' as a method by which the quality of a partition can be measured in community detection of networks. In \"Resolution limit in community detection\" Fortunato and Barthelemy (2008) point out that while Newman and Girvan's method of modularity led to important advances in community detection, the acutal properties of modularity have not been thoroughly investigated. $^1$ They demonstrate how communities defined by modularity have limitations; specifically, they show both theoretically and experimentally that modularity has an inherent scale that depends on the degree of interconnctedness between pairs of communities within a network structure. When modules are smaller than this scale they cannot be “resolved.” In other words, regardless of the size of a network, through modularity optimization one cannot know if a module is a single module or a cluster of smaller modules. Important substructures can be lossed while finding the maximal modularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Berry et al.(2011) in \"Tolerating the community detection resolution limit with edge weighting\" go on to reexamine   Fortunato and Barthelemy's analysis on the resolution limit of modularity and show that by adding weights to the edges of the network one can improve the accuracy for detecting communities in real networks. In exploring the resolution limit from the context of edge weighting, Berry et el. offer an alternative inequality that defines a module that takes into account the sum of weights. While this inequality still has resolution limits, it is able to account for greater detection of substructures. Further, Berry et al. go on to delineate how some community detection algorithms can account for maximum weighted modularity. \n",

A ring of cliques graph consists of cliques (i.e. modules) connected through single links. Each clique represents a complete graph. The 128-node benchmark data is a simple artificial graph with a built-in community structure that tries to reflect the real properties of nodes and communities found in real networks.
