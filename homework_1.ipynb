    "As k goes to infinity the normalized values at each node will converge to a stable set of values and will remain fixed at the point of convergence. Because the hub and authority scores are proportional to each other, independent of what initial values with which you begin (provided they are positive), the approximate scores will reach an equilibrium (i.e. limit) over time. The Hub Authority ranking procedure provides an information retrieval system that takes into consideration both quality (weights based on endorsements) and quantity (weights based on the number of sites each hub/authority is pointing to and from). Thus, these scores are purely dependent on the link structure and as such sites can be powerful endorsers without themeslves being heavily endorsed. Said differently, a good hub is a page that points to many good authorities and a good authority is referenced by many hubs. "
